# Marginalia

> **Status**: In Progress | **Phase**: 8 (In-App UX Polish, Boundary Fixes & Explanation Audit)  
> **Current**: Fixed card padding and boundary clipping across Android app and Web reader. Resolved badge/book-title overlap with 12-14dp vertical separation. Fixed Daily Cards bottom pills clipping into deck corners by adding horizontal clip padding and centering. Reduced explanation font to 16sp (app) / 1.04rem (web) for comfortable reading. Replaced rigid "teacher" prose with clear, grounded analytical explanations. Release APK compiled and signed at `android/marginalia.apk`.  
> **Next**: User verification of layout fixes on device and deeper audit of shelf explanations.

## Roadmap

- [x] Phase 1: Foundational directives — update CLAUDE.md and VOICE.md to strip out marketing/SaaS slant
- [x] Phase 2: Content audit and revision — rewrite 69 cards in `content/cards.json` to focus on writing craft
- [x] Phase 3: Validation — verify zero flags in `python3 tools/lint_cards.py` and clean `build_prototype.py`
- [x] Phase 4: Curate stronger quotes — add 5 gold-standard cards (Manto, Baldwin, Didion, Dillard, Burkeman) & expand `content/quote-bank.md`
- [x] Phase 5: GitHub synchronization — commit and push updates to `terriblyoffendedmarketer-stack/quotes-project`
- [x] Phase 6: Master Quote Bank mining — extract 800–1,200 quotes across 400+ books using local offline AI without token burnout (Reached 1,871 quotes / 416 books)
- [x] Phase 7: Quote Bank UI & Integration — Thematic horizons web reader, dynamic tag discovery, and dual-mode Android widget integration

## Setup & run instructions

- Python tools require only the Python 3 standard library:
  - Run linter: `python3 tools/lint_cards.py`
  - Rebuild web prototype: `python3 tools/build_prototype.py`
- GitHub sync:
  - Push updates: `git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push origin main`
  - The Android app auto-downloads `content/cards.json` from the GitHub repo every few hours.

## Key decisions & content rules

- **Focus**: Pure writing craft, personal essays, storytelling, observation, and prose rhythm. Never pivot to marketing, SaaS, corporate, or sales jargon.
- **Android, always**: Home-screen widget + full-screen reader. Slides drawn directly into widget views (no StackView or RemoteViewsService adapters).
- **JSON backwards compatibility**: `content/cards.json` is fetched by live app installs. Adding fields is fine; renaming or deleting fields breaks installed apps.
- **Slide structure**:
  1. *How to (Hook)*: The job, as large as it fits, plus author name.
  2. *The line*: The quote (punchy one-liner or passage up to ~120 words). Passes the cold-reader test.
  3. *Look closer*: The unexpected craft angle (close reading, structural move, dead metaphor, or scene).
  4. *Steal it*: One concrete writing exercise under 60 words for essays, articles, or prose. No SaaS/marketing.
  5. *Around it*: True contextual/biographical facts ending on an open question. Under 100 words.
- **Verification**: Every quote verified against published text. Name translator for translated works.
- **Oliver Burkeman**: Owner's favourite book is *Four Thousand Weeks*. Burkeman cards are prime models for working passages.
